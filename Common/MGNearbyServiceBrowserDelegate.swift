/** The MGNearbyServiceBrowserDelegate protocol defines methods that a MGNearbyServiceBrowser objectâ€™s delegate can implement to handle browser-related and invitation events. Since all activity is asynchronous in nature, you cannot make any assumptions of the thread on which the delegate's methods will be called.
